# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms explicitly avoided there.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
